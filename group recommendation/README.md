This Python script is a recommendation engine for movies based on group preferences. Here's a brief overview:

Imports and Setup:

Imports libraries (warnings, numpy, and pandas) and silences specific warnings.
Loads a dataset of movie ratings (ratings.csv) and limits it to 5000 rows for faster execution.
Group Preference Functions:

Defines three functions to compute aggregated ratings for a group:
group_pred_by_avg: Computes the average rating for a movie among the group's ratings.
group_pred_by_least_misery: Returns the minimum (least favorable) rating for a movie in the group.
group_pred_with_disagreements: Evaluates group disagreement by adjusting ratings relative to a midpoint (2.5) and averaging.
Group Ratings Aggregation:

Filters ratings for a specified group of users and combines them.
Recommendation Computation:

Computes top-20 movie recommendations based on:
Average aggregation (group_pred_by_avg).
Least misery aggregation (group_pred_by_least_misery).
Consideration of disagreements (group_pred_with_disagreements).
Output:

Prints sorted recommendations by each aggregation method.
This script is designed to explore group-based recommendation strategies and how aggregation methods impact results.
